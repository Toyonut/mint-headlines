# Mint-Headlines

This is a simple scraper to read the Linux Mint headlines off the RSS feed. Pretty basic, but it mostly works.

## TODO:
* ~add configurable amount of headlines to print.~
* see if I can work out how to fix the random unicode in the console output properly.
* better error handling.
* build properly to make Linux and Windows tools instead of running from dotnet run.
